Hello, hello, and welcome to TTMC. This game was created using [RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) and is based on the [RMC14](https://github.com/RMC-14/RMC-14) codebase.
The project is an unofficial port of TGMC from Space Station 13 to the RT engine. It is based on two builds: [TGMC](https://github.com/tgstation/TerraGov-Marine-Corps) itself and [Unga Marines](https://github.com/PMC-Unga-Marines/Unga-Marines).
